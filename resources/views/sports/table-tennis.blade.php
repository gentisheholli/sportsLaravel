                <p>Table tennis, also known as ping-pong and whiff-whaff, is a sport in which two or four players hit a
                    lightweight ball, also known as the ping-pong ball, back and forth across a table using small
                    rackets. The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net. Except for the initial serve, the
                    rules are generally as follows: players must allow a ball played toward them to bounce one time on
                    their side of the table, and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side at least once.
                </p>

            <div class="col-12 col-md-6 p-4 text-justify">
                <p>Table tennis is governed by the worldwide organization International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF),
                    founded in 1926. ITTF currently includes 226 member associations. The table tennis official rules
                    are specified in the ITTF handbook. Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988, with
                    several event categories. From 1988 until 2004, these were men's singles, women's singles, men's
                    doubles and women's doubles. Since 2008, a team event has been played instead of the doubles.</p>

            <div class="col-12 p-4 text-justify">
                <p>According to ITTF rule 2.13.1, the first service is decided by lot, normally a coin toss. It
                    is also common for one player (or the umpire/scorer) to hide the ball in one or the other hand,
                    usually hidden under the table, allowing the other player to guess which hand the ball is in. The
                    correct or incorrect guess gives the "winner" the option to choose to serve, receive, or to choose
                    which side of the table to use. (A common but non-sanctioned method is for the players to play the
                    ball back and forth three times and then play out the point. This is commonly referred to as "serve
                    to play", "rally to serve", "play for serve", or "volley for serve".)</p>
