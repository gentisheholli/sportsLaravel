                <p>Basketball, colloquially referred to as hoops, is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly
                    of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary
                    objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the
                    defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a
                    backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their
                    own hoop.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-12 col-md-6 p-4 text-justify">
                <p>Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a
                    teammate, both of which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of
                    shots—the lay-up, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler,
                    intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed
                    shot that bounces from rim or backboard. It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without
                    dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-12 p-4 text-justify">
                <p>The five players on each side fall into five playing positions. The tallest player is usually the
                    center, the second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more agile
                    player is the small forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting
                    guard and the point guard, who implements the coach's game plan by managing the execution of
                    offensive and defensive plays (player positioning). Informally, players may play three-on-three,
                    two-on-two, and one-on-one.</p>
