                <p>Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer,[a] is a team sport played with a
                    spherical ball between two teams of 11 players. It is played by approximately 250 million players in
                    over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport. The game is played on
                    a
                    rectangular field called a pitch with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to outscore the
                    opposition by moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing goal. The team with the higher
                    number of goals wins the game.</p>

            <div class="col-12 col-md-6 p-4 text-justify">
                <p>Football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game. The two teams
                    each
                    compete to get the ball into
                    the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. The team that
                    has
                    scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of
                    goals then the game is a draw. Each team is led by a captain who has only one official
                    responsibility as
                    mandated by the Laws of the Game: to represent their team in the coin toss prior to kick-off or
                    penalty
                    kicks.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-12 p-4 text-justify">
                <p>Players are not allowed to touch the ball with hands or arms while it is in play, except for the
                    goalkeepers within the penalty area. Other players mainly use their feet to strike or pass the ball,
                    but
                    may also use any other part of their body except the hands and the arms. The team that scores most
                    goals
                    by the end of the match wins. If the score is level at the end of the game, either a draw is
                    declared or
                    the game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition.</p>
