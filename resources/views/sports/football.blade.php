                <p>American football, referred to simply as football in the United States and Canada and also known as
                    gridiron, is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with
                    goalposts at each end. The offense, the team with possession of the oval-shaped football, attempts
                    to advance down the field by running with the ball or passing it, while the defense, the team
                    without possession of the ball, aims to stop the offense's advance and to take control of the ball
                    for themselves.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-12 col-md-6 p-4 text-justify">
                <p>The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays; if they fail, they turn over the
                    football to the defense, but if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs to continue the
                    drive. Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a
                    touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the
                    most points at the end of a game wins.</p>

                <p>American football evolved in the United States, originating from the sports of soccer and rugby. The
                    first American football match was played on November 6, 1869, between two college teams, Rutgers and
                    Princeton, using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time. A set of rule changes drawn up from
                    1880 onward by Walter Camp, the "Father of American Football", established the snap, the line of
                    scrimmage, eleven-player teams, and the concept of downs. Later rule changes legalized the forward
                    pass, created the neutral zone and specified the size and shape of the football. The sport is
                    closely related to Canadian football, which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the
                    American game (although their rules were developed independently from those of Camp). Most of the
                    features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian
                    football. The two sports are considered the primary variants of gridiron football.</p>
