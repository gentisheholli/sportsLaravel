                <p>Hockey is a sport in which two teams play against each other by trying to manoeuvre a ball or a puck
                    into the opponent's goal using a hockey stick. There are many types of hockey such as bandy, field
                    hockey, ice hockey and rink hockey. In most of the world, the term hockey by itself refers to field
                    hockey, while in Canada, the United
                    States, Russia and most of Eastern and Northern Europe, the term usually refers to ice hockey.</p>

                <p>Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually in a rink, in which two teams of skaters
                    use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent's net to score goals. The
                    sport is known to be fast-paced and physical, with teams usually fielding six players at a time: one
                    goaltender, and five players who skate the span of the ice trying to control the puck and score
                    goals against the opposing team.</p>

                <p>Ice hockey is most popular in Canada, central and eastern Europe, the Nordic countries, Russia, and
                    the United States. Ice hockey is the official national winter sport of Canada. In addition, ice
                    hockey is the most popular winter sport in Belarus, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Finland, Latvia,
                    Russia, Slovakia, Sweden, and Switzerland. North America's National Hockey League (NHL) is the
                    highest level for men's ice hockey and the strongest professional ice hockey league in the world.
                    The Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) is the highest league in Russia and much of Eastern Europe. The
                    International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) is the formal governing body for international ice
                    hockey, with the IIHF managing international tournaments and maintaining the IIHF World Ranking.
                    Worldwide, there are ice hockey federations in 76 countries.</p>

                <p>The 2021 IIHF World Championship will be co-hosted by Minsk, Belarus and Riga, Latvia, as the IIHF
                    announced on 19 May 2017. It will take place from 21 May to 6 June 2021. Their joint bid won
                    by a very tight margin against the Finnish bid with the cities of Tampere and Helsinki. Each city
                    will host one group and two quarter-final games, with both semi-finals and the medal games to be
                    played in Minsk. It will be the second time hosting for both cities; Minsk was the sole host of the
                    2014 IIHF World Championship, while Riga hosted the 2006 IIHF World Championship.</p>

                <p>The World Cup of Hockey is an international ice hockey tournament. Inaugurated in 1996, it is the
                    successor to the Canada Cup, which was held every 3 to 5 years from 1976 to 1991 and was the first
                    international hockey championship to allow nations to field their top players. The World Cup has
                    occurred thrice before on an irregular basis, with the United States winning in 1996 and Canada
                    winning in 2004 and 2016. Following the 2016 tournament, it is uncertain if the series will
